# Introduction to Version Control

Think of version control as a "time machine" for developers. It allows people to:
- Track changes made throughout the code
- Restore previous versions of the project in case something goes wrong
- Work with others without getting in each other's way

Git is the most popular version control system out there today, since it allows people to integrate their work so seamlessly.
