# Collaborating with GitHub

Github is a platform for hosting Git repositories online. Fun fact, you are on GitHub right now!

## Pushing Code - Link your repository to GitHub and push the code in
- ''bash
- git remote add origin https://github.com/exampleusername/repo.git
- git push -u origin main

## Pull Requests
Pull requests let you propose changes to current code and review it before it is merged. You could propose changes and then have someone else review it before it is implemented. This prevents mistakes, encourages collaboration, and is how businesses develop their code.
