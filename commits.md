# Working with Commits

Commits are snapshots of your project at any given time. Think of these similarly to how you view checkpoints in a video game.

## Basic Workflow
1. **Stage changes** (tells Git which files to track):
- '''bash
- git add filename
2. **Commit changes** (save them permanently in history):
- git commit -m "Describe your changes"

## Example
If you edited a file called file.html:
- git add file.html
- git commit -m "Added homepage structure"

Now, that change has been recorded
